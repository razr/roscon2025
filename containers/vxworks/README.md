# ü¶æ ROS 2 VxWorks OCI Containers

This directory provides two Dockerfiles that describe ROS 2 example applications ‚Äî a `minimal publisher` and a `minimal subscriber` ‚Äî packaged as OCI-compliant containers for VxWorks.
They can be pulled directly from Docker Hub or built with `buildah`. Both containers are ready-to-execute VxWorks RTP (Real-Time Process) images configured for ROS 2 communication.

## üöÄ Quick Start ‚Äî Use Pre-Built Images

Pre-built images are available under:
üëâ https://hub.docker.com/u/razr

To try the publisher example right away:

```bash
# Pull the pre-built ROS 2 VxWorks publisher example
buildah pull docker.io/razr/vxworks:publisher_lambda
```

To run the subscriber example:

```bash
buildah pull docker.io/razr/vxworks:subscriber_lambda
```

## üß± Build Images Locally with Buildah

To build the containers from source, first retrieve the ROS 2 environment artifact and mount it:

1. Download the **HDD image qemu humble.zip** artifact from:  
   üëâ [https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-ros2-build/actions](https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-ros2-build/actions)

2. Unzip the archive under `~/Downloads`:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
unzip "HDD image qemu humble.zip"

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razr/roscon2025.git
cd roscon2025/containers/vxworks
```

3. Mount the extracted ros2.img as a loop device:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p ~/Downloads/rootfs
sudo mount -o loop ros2.img ~/Downloads/rootfs
```

4. Build the ROS 2 VxWorks example containers with Buildah, using the mounted filesystem as the build context:

```bash
# Build the publisher example
buildah bud -t publisher_lambda -f Dockerfile.publisher_lambda ~/Downloads/rootfs

# Build the subscriber example
buildah bud -t subscriber_lambda -f Dockerfile.subscriber_lambda ~/Downloads/rootfs
```

5. When done, unmount the image:

```bash
sudo umount ~/Downloads/rootfs
```

## ‚úÖ Verify the Build

List local images

```bash
$ buildah images
REPOSITORY                         TAG      IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
localhost/publisher_lambda         latest   8c24961396dc   11 minutes ago   41.4 MB
localhost/subscriber_lambda        latest   8c24961396dc   11 minutes ago   41.4 MB
```

## üì¶ Export as OCI Archive

To export a container image as a portable OCI archive:

```bash
buildah push publisher_lambda oci-archive:publisher_lambda.oci
buildah push publisher_lambda oci-archive:subscriber_lambda.oci
```

Import it later:

buildah pull oci-archive:publisher_lambda.oci

## üß† Notes

These containers are OCI-compliant and fully compatible with `buildah` and `Podman`.
Each container bundles all required VxWorks runtime and ROS 2 shared libraries.
The labels inside each Dockerfile define VxWorks RTP launch parameters (stack size, priority, etc.).

Mounted volumes (`/ram0`, `/dev/random`, `/dev/urandom`, `/dev/shm`) are configured to mount VxWorks I/O devices and filesystems to the containers.
